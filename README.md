This is an attempt to open a repository of the scripts I have written for various zooniverse projects.
It is a work in progress and I am learning GitHub as I go.

The first script I want to set up is a DBSCAN point clustering routine and Demo for it.
This DBSCAN clustering algorithm is intended for data sets which are limited to a few hundred points â€“ it is not optimized for R-trees or large data sets, but works well for the data sets expected from drawing tool uses in zooniverse projects.
