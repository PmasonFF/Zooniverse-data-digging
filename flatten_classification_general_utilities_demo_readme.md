The file flatten_classification_general_utilities_demo.py  is the basic frame with some of the general utilities blocks merged into it. It uses the fossil_finder_classification_test.csv as the input file, and two picklists (one for generating a user_name for higher volume not-logged-in users, and one for adding a image-number based on the camera image number)
The order of the fields in the output file was modified, and at this point the annotations column has not been flattened (this demo is only to show the general utilities merged with the basic frame).

The file flatten_classification_general_utilities_demo_2.py is a second example, in this case parsing the subject_data field to obtain an image_name from the filename uploaded with the images.  Unlike the previous example above, the comments in the Frame have been left and the order of the output field was not modified - ie this merge has been done with minimal customization using the building blocks as they are, as much as possible.
