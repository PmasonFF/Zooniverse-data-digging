"""This script plot_data_interactive.py takes the output from an aggregated drawing .csv file
which contains data points and drawings to be over-layed on the original subject image. A legend
and title, and data labels are added.

The source for the subject image which is used for the plot background is the actual zooniverse hosted
subject.  Using lookup_url.py, a lookup table of subject-url is created from the subject download from
the project.  This uses subject set and workflow_id to select the appropriate subjects and their urls.
We then use this lookup table keyed by subject to find the url for the zooniverse hosted image, and
used the url to download the image to our plot background.

Once the plot has been created and displayed, there are two options to save it.  One saves the plot as
a jpeg file with approximately the same resolution as the original image.  The down side to this approach
is the points and circles plotted on the image are a fixed size in the pixels of the image - zooming the
image increases the size of the point markers and circle line width, obscuring the image.

The second way to store the image is as a pickle file â€“ sort of an interrupted python script where the
plot is put on hold.  To reactivate it, it must be loaded with a Python script that unpacks the pickled
file, essentially returning us to the point the file was put on hold.  The advantage of this approach
is the background image is the original subject image with no resolution loss and the pan and zoom widgets
of the original plot work as before.  Now if one zooms in the point size and circle line widths do not
change in on-screen pixels so the image is not obscured by large points and thick lines.
